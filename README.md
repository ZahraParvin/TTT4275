# TTT4275 - Estimation, Detection and Classification Project

Spring 2024

The classification project consists of two parts. The first part being
the classification of three species of the Iris flower and the second part being the classification
of handwritten numbers from 0-9. The classifications is performed by designing classifiers using
supervised learning. The classifiers in both parts of this project are first trained by feeding them
sets of labeled data, called training sets, and then let it classify an unlabeled test set.

## Course Content

This course focuses on visual perception and image processing, covering key mathematical tools and operations such as matrices, linear/non-linear transformations, and frequency analysis, image formation, camera models, and geometry for single and multiple views. The course also includes feature extraction, pose estimation, and motion analysis.

Also, it explores Localization and Mapping with SLAM, covering both indirect (feature-based) and direct methods, as well as sensor combinations like IMU and RGB-Depth. Finally, it discusses briefly object detection, recognition, and scene understanding, providing a comprehensive approach to visual systems.
