# TTT4275 - Estimation, Detection and Classification Project
Spring 2024 
## About this Project
In Collaboration with Philip Shahdadfar

The classification project consists of two parts. The first part being
the classification of three species of the Iris flower and the second part being the classification
of handwritten numbers from 0-9. The classifications is performed by designing classifiers using
supervised learning. The classifiers in both parts of this project are first trained by feeding them
sets of labeled data, called training sets, and then let it classify an unlabeled test set.

## Course Content
